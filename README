Freeze Race is based fully on race mod, the only difference is that players has collision and there are freeze tiles.
Freeze Mod was created for testing purposes only, Because some people only like DDRace with freeze tiles only, and so i created this mod to help them reach their goal and also to see if they will be able to make interesting maps with as little features as speeders teleports and speedup tiles or not.
